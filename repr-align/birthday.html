# In the last year

* 9 Rust releases!
  * From 1.9 in May 2016 to 1.17 in April 2017
* Improved error messages
* MIR being enabled by default in the compiler, unlocking new features
* Reducing compile times, including incremental compilation
* The `?` operator
* `rustup` reached 1.0
* Custom derive
* Many many standard library stabilisations
* Many `cargo` improvements
* Rust language ergonomics initiative announced
* That's really glossing over a lot of work that's happened but I'm going to talk too much tonight as it is!
