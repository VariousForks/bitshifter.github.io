# An Introduction to Rust

---
layout: false

# Thanks!

I threw this together at the last minute based on other peoples presentations:

* Daniel Collin ([@daniel_collin](http://twitter.com/daniel_collin)) from DICE whose slides I based this on
* Alex Crichton from Mozilla Research whose were used in Daniel's presentation

# What is Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

---

# A short history

* Rust grew out of a personal project by Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare
* Mozilla sponsored starting in 2009
* Rust itself is community driven under Apache/MIT licence
* Went 1.0 in May 2015
* Mozilla are also developing a new browser engine in Rust called Servo

---

# Why Rust?

* C/C++: More control, less safety
* Java/.NET/Python: Less control, more safety
* Rust: More control, more safety

---

# Systems programming

* Fine grained control over allocations
* No mandatory garbage collector
* Minimal runtime
* Statically typed

---

# Runs fast

* Compiles to an executable binary
* LLVM backend (Same backend as Clang for Mac/iOS/PS4)
* LLVM's suite of optimizations
* Competitive with C/C++

---

# Prevents almost all crashes

* _Safe by default_
* Sophisticated type system and analysis
* No segfaults
* No null pointers
* No dangling pointers

---

# Eliminates data races

* _Ownership_ guarantees
* _Borrowing_ prevents dangling pointers
* Strong, safe abstractions

---

# Ownership

Variables are moved to new locations, preventing the previous location from using them. There is only every one owner of data! 

---

# Ownership

```rust
int main() {
    int* data = malloc(sizeof(int));
    *data = 3;
    foo(slot);
    foo(slot); // use after free!
}

void foo(int* data) {
    printf("The number was: %d\n", *data);
    free(data);
}

```

```bash
a.out(62940,0x7fff7b9ea310) malloc: *** error for object 0x7fecb0c03b10:
pointer being freed was not allocated
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
zsh: abort      ./a.out
```

---

# Ownership

```rust
fn foo(slot: Box<u32>) {
    println!("The number was: {}", slot);
}

fn main() {
    let data = Box::new(3);
    foo(data); // moves the value!
    foo(data); // error: use of moved value
}
```

```bash
test.rs:6:9: 6:13 error: use of moved value: `data` [E0382]
test.rs:6     foo(data); // error: use of moved value
                 ^~~~
test.rs:5:9: 5:13 note: `data` moved here because it has type 'Box<u32>',
                         which is non-copyable
test.rs:5     foo(data); // moves the value!
                 ^~~~
error: aborting due to previous error

```

???

In C++ use after move is not a compile error.

---

# Ownership

The equivalent code in Modern C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

void foo(std::unique_ptr<int> slot) {
    std::cout << "The number was: " << *slot << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    auto data = std::make_unique<int>(3);
    foo(std::move(data)); // moves the value!
    foo(std::move(data)); // error? use of moved value
}
```

```bash
The number was: 3
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

---

# Ownership

```rust
fn foo() -> Box<u32> {
    let three = Box::new(3);
    return three; // transfer ownership
}

fn main() {
    // acquire ownership of return value
    let my_three = foo();
}

```

---
template: inverse
# Borrowing

Owned values can be borrowed in Rust to allow usage for a certain period of time.

---

# Borrowing

```rust
// The `&` sigil means "borrowed reference"
fn foo(slot: &Vec<u32>) { /* ... */ }

fn main() {
    let data = Vec::new();

    // doesn't move!
    foo(&data);
    foo(&data);
}
```

---

# Borrowing

Borrowed values are only valid for a particular _lifetime_

```rust
let a: &u32;
{
    let b = 3;
    a = &b; // error! `b` does not live long enough
}

```

```rust
let b = 3;
let a: &u32;
a = &b; // ok, `b` has the same lifetime as `a`

```

---

# Borrowing

Borrowing prevents _moving_

```rust
let a = Vec::new();
let b = &a;
work_with(a); // error!

```

```rust
let a = Vec::new();
{
    let b = &a;
}
work_with(a); // ok
```

---

# Borrowing

A mistake that happens in C/C++:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Your number was: {}", *foo());
}

// Tries to return borrowed reference to `a`
fn foo() -> &u32 {
    let a = 3;
    return &a;
}
```

---

# Borrowing

Borrows can be nested

```rust
struct MyStruct { inner: u32 }

fn get(s: &MyStruct) -> &u32 {
    &s.inner
}

fn main() {
    let s = MyStruct { inner: 3 };
    let inner = get(&s); // same lifetime as `s`
}
```

---

# Borrowing

Borrowed values can become owned values through _cloning_

```rust
fn clone_vector(v: &Vec<u32>) -> Vec<u32> {
    v.clone()
}
```

---
template: inverse

# Memory Management

Rust has fine-grained memory management, but is automatically managed once created.

---

# Memory Management

Each variable has a _scope_ it is valid for, and it is automatically deallocated when it goes out of scope

```rust
fn main() {
    // main owns 'data'
    let data = Box::new(4);
    // The data goes out of scope, it is free'd
}

```

---

# Memory Management

Also possible to explicitly free data using _drop_

```rust
fn main() {
    // main owns 'data'
    let data = Box::new(4);
    // Do something with data here..
    // ...
    // Now free data
    drop(data);
    // Compile error if we try to use data 
    println!("Trying to use data {}", data);
}
```

---

# Memory Management

Reference counting is another way of managing memory

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let data = Rc::new(3); // reference count of 1
    {
        let data2 = data.clone(); // reference count of 2
        use_data(data2); // transfer ownership of `data2`
    } // reference count of 1
    use_data(data); // transfer ownership of `data`
} // reference count of 0, memory deallocated

fn use_data(data: Rc<u32>) {}
```

# Mutability

Values are _immutable_ by default in Rust, and must be tagged as being _mutable_.

---

# Mutability

```rust
let a = 4;
a = 5; // error!
```

```rust
let mut a = 4;
a = 5; // ok
```

---

# Mutability

Mutability is also a part of the type of a borrowed pointer

```rust
fn inc(i: &i32) {
    *i += 1; // error!
}
```

```rust
fn inc(i: &mut i32) {
    *i += 1; // ok
}
```

---

# Mutability

Borrowed pointers may coerce

```rust
let a = &mut 1;
let b: &i32 = a; // ok
let c: &mut i32 = b; // error!
```

---

# Mutability

Values can be _frozen_ by borrowing

```rust
let mut a = Vec::new();
{
    let b = &a; // freezes `a`
    a.push(1);  // error!
}
a.push(2); // ok
```

---

# Mutability

Mutability propagates deeply into owned types

```rust
struct A { b: B }
struct B { c: i32 }
fn main() {
    let mut a = A { b: B { c: 2 } };
    a.b.c = 3;
    a.b = B { c: 4 };
    a = A { b: B { c: 5 } };

    let frozen = a;
    frozen.b.c = 4; // error!
}
```

# Concurrency

Using ownership to prevent data races

---

# Concurrency

Parallelism is achieved at the granularity of an OS thread but it's also possible to use libraries like threadpool

```rust
// Spawn a child thread to be run in parallel
spawn(move || {
    expensive_computation();
});

other_expensive_computation();
```

---

# Concurrency

Safety is achieve by requiring spawn to use 'move' closure to capture variables

```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let mut a = Vec::new();
    thread::spawn(move || {
        a.push("foo");
    });
    a.push("bar"); // error!
}
```

---

# Concurrency

Threads can communicate with channels

```rust
let (tx, rx) = channel();

spawn(move || {
    tx.send(expensive_computation());
});

// Do some work in the meantime
let answer = rx.recv();
```



---

# Concurrency

Tasks can also share memory

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert("tomato", "red");
    map.insert("celery", "green");
    map.insert("carrot", "orange");

    let arc1 = Arc::new(map);
    let arc2 = arc1.clone();

    spawn(move || println!("Celery is `{}`", arc1["celery"]));
    spawn(move || println!("Carrots are `{}`", arc2["carrot"]));
}
```

---

# Concurrency

Using a Mutex it's possible to modify shared state

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

// Mutex is design so it be owner of a piece of data and
// use borrowing to lend it to others 
fn main() {
    let data = Arc::new(Mutex::new(4));
    for _ in 0..10 {
       let thread_data = data.clone();
       thread::spawn(move || {
           let mut data = thread_data.lock().unwrap();
           *data += 1;
        });
    }
}
```

# Data types impl and traits

---

# Structs

```rust
struct Point {
    x: f32,
    y: f32,
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 1.0, y: 2.0 };
}
```

---

# Impl

```rust
struct Circle {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    radius: f64,
}

impl Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * (self.radius * self.radius)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let c = Circle { x: 0.0, y: 0.0, radius: 2.0 };
    println!("{}", c.area());
}
```

---

# Enums

```rust
enum Shape {
    Circle,
    Square
}

fn test(shape: Shape) {
    match shape {
        Circle => { /* ... */ }
        Square => { /* ... */ }
    }
}
```

---

# Enums

Enums can have data. This is compiled into a union + tag

```rust
enum Shape {
    Circle(Point, f64),
    Rectangle(Point, Point),
}

match shape {
    Circle(center, radius) => {
        draw_circle(center, radius)
    }
    Rectangle(ul, lr) => {
        draw_rectangle(ul, lr)
    }
}
```

---

# & pointers

```rust
let a: &int = ...;         // never null!
let b: Option<&int> = ...; // may be null

// represented as a null pointer
let c: Option<&int> = None;
```

---

# &mut pointers

Any &mut pointer is the only pointer to its data

```rust
let mut a = 1;

let b = &mut a; // ok
let c = &mut a; // error!
```

---

# Traits

```rust
struct Circle {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    radius: f64,
}

trait HasArea {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

impl HasArea for Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * (self.radius * self.radius)
    }
}
```

---

# Traits in generics

```rust
fn print_area<T>(shape: T) {
    println!("This shape has an area of {}", shape.area());
}
```

```
error: no method named `area` found for type `T` in the current scope
```

```rust
fn print_area<T: HasArea>(shape: T) {
    println!("This shape has an area of {}", shape.area());
}
```

---

# Impl traits on any type

Traits can also be applied on existing types

```rust
trait HasArea {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

impl HasArea for i32 {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        println!("this is silly");

        *self as f64
    }
}

fn main() {
    5.area(); // Considered bad style!
}
```

# Breaking the rules

---

# Unsafe blocks

* Possible to skip some compiler checks
* Used to build safe code around unsafe blocks
* Can audit only unsafe blocks for issues
* FFI (Foreign Function Interface) is always unsafe

---

# Unsafe blocks

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = 3;

    // Turn off some compiler checks,
    // "I know what I'm doing"
    unsafe {
        let b = &a as *const i32 as *mut i32;
        *b = 4;
    }

    println!("{}", a); // prints 4
}
```

---

# Transmuting

Transform one type to another

```rust
unsafe fn transmute<T, U>(t: T) -> U {
    /* ... */
}

```rust
// Invalid promotion to a mutable pointer
let a: &int = &3;
let b: &mut int = unsafe { transmute(a) };
```

---

# Inline assembly

```rust
#[cfg(any(target_arch = "x86", target_arch = "x86_64"))]
fn foo() {
    unsafe {
        asm!("nop");
    }
}
```

---

# FFI

```rust
extern {
    fn write(fd: i32, data: *const u8, len: u32) -> i32;
}

fn main() {
    let data = b"Hello, world!\n";

    unsafe {
        write(1, &data[0], data.len() as u32);
    }
}
```

---

# _Fast_  FFI

```asm

	.cfi_startproc
	leaq	byte_str2755(%rip), %rsi
	movl	$1, %edi

# Cargo

* Cargo is Rusts package manager
* Makes it possible to download dependencies for a project
* Invokes _rustc_ or other tools to build projects
* Uses _crates_ for packaging up modules in a library
* Standard build and distribution system, making working with Rust projects easier

---

# Cargo

Defining a _Cargo.toml_ file for a project

```ini
[package]
name = "hello_world"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name you@example.com"]

[dependencies]
regex = "0.1.41"
```

---

# Cargo

```rust
extern crate regex;

use regex::Regex;

fn main() {
    let re = Regex::new(r"^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$").unwrap();
    println!("Did our date match? {}", re.is_match("2014-01-01"));
}
```

# Should you use Rust?

# Should you use Rust?

* C++ is modernising but slowly, e.g. C++17 :(
* C++ will never ditch it's legacy
* Rust is new - only went 1.0 a year ago
  * 1.0 means language and std library is stable
  * But still might not have features you need yet
* The language is quite different
  * concepts ownership, borrowing and lifetime are unique
  * can be challenging to adjust to
* More accessible to people from high level languages
  * people from languages like Ruby
  * people who wouldn't touch C++
* Community development process seems more agile than C++
* Rust is moving quickly - already at 1.7!
* Tied to Mozilla's health?
* Too early to tell if it will become a mainstream language?
* Did I mention no data races?
