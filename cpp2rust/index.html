# From C++ to Rust

Beyond the Borrow Checker

---
layout: false

# Some background

* 10 years of C++ in games industry
* PS2, PS3, Xbox360, Wii, PC
* Many CPU/GPU and memory constrained systems
* C/C++ used in games for
 * CPU Performance
 * Manual memory management
 * Close to hardware
 * Legacy
* C++ is fun but has many pitfalls

.footnote[.red[*] Press 'P' for slide notes]

???

* How many C or C++ programmers in the audience?
* Won't cover Hello World level stuff
* Won't talk about borrow checker, it's been covered a lot already
* Feel free to ask questions as we go.

* Been dabbling in Rust for about a year
* Documentation has got a lot better over this time!
* Interested in Rust because it's could be a viable C++ replacement
* Wrote some sorting algorithms, wanted to write a more complete program
* Want to learn more Rust

# SuperBible in Rust

---

# SuperBible samples

* Simple application framework and many example applications
* Simple math library
* Object class for loading and rendering meshes
* Texture class for loading and rendering images
* GLSL shader compilation
* Uses GLFW for windowing and input

???

* Non exhaustive list of Rust things to know for porting
* Going to skim a lot quickly to give overview
* Will show a lot of code, but more interested in introducing concepts

# Application framework

Defines an application interface class which samples derive from.

```cpp
class application {
  APPINFO info;
  static application * app;
public:
  virtual void run(application* the_app) { /* default impl */ }
  virtual void init() { /* default impl */ }
  virtual void startup() {}
  virtual void render(double currentTime) {}
  virtual void shutdown() {}
  virtual void onResize(int w, int h) { /* default impl */ }
  virtual void onKey(int key, int action) {}
};
```

Main entry point instantiates sample and calls run.

```cpp
int main(int argc, const char ** argv) {
    sample_app app;
    app->run(&app);
}
```

???

* APPINFO is initialisation struct setup by virtual init
* Static app is used for event callbacks from GLFW.
* Virtual run is main loop, calls virtual startup, shutdown, render etc
* Run doesn't really need to be a virtual member, could be static
* Each sample inherits from this, overrides startup, render and shutdown

---

# Application framework

How to do this in Rust? Create a trait.

```rust
pub trait App {
    fn get_app_info(&self) -> &AppInfo;
    fn startup(&mut self) {}
    fn update(&mut self, _: f64) {}
    fn render(&self, _: f64) {}
    fn shutdown(&mut self) {}
    fn on_resize(&mut self, _: isize, _: isize) {}
    fn on_key(&mut self, _: Key, _: Action) {}
}
```

The `run` function takes a parameter which implements the App trait.

```rust
pub fn run<T: App>(app: &mut T) { /* default impl */ }
```

---

# Application sample

Each sample provides a struct which implements the `App` trait.

```rust
extern crate sb6;

struct SampleApp { info: sb6::AppInfo }

impl SampleApp {
  fn new(init: sb6::AppInfo) -> SampleApp { /* impl */ }
}

impl sb6::App for SampleApp {
    fn get_app_info(&self) -> &sb6::AppInfo { &self.info }
    fn startup(&mut self) { /* impl */ }
    fn render(&self, _: f64) { /* impl */ }
    fn shutdown(&mut self) { /* impl */ }
}

fn main() {
    let mut init = sb6::AppInfo::default();
    init.title = "Hello Rust 1.0.0!";
    let mut app = SampleApp::new(init);
    sb6::run(&mut app);
}
```

???

* From C++ virtual to Rust trait
* Kept same structure
* A bit of boilerplate, would be good to get rid of App::get_app_info()
* Don't need virtual, compile time polymorphism for the win
* Code and data separate! Struct and Trait
* Traits are awesome

# C++ file loading

This is an abridged snippet of model loading code.

```cpp
FILE * infile = fopen(filename, "rb");

fseek(infile, 0, SEEK_END);
size_t filesize = ftell(infile);
fseek(infile, 0, SEEK_SET);

char * data = new char[filesize];
fread(data, filesize, 1, infile);

char * ptr = data;
SB6M_HEADER * header = (SB6M_HEADER *)ptr;
ptr += header->size;

for (unsigned int i = 0; i < header->num_chunks; i++) {
   SB6M_CHUNK_HEADER * chunk = (SB6M_CHUNK_HEADER *)ptr;
   ptr += chunk->size;
   switch (chunk->chunk_type) { /* process chunk record */ }
}

delete [] data;
fclose(infile);
```

???

* OK, it's practically C
* No error handling in this example
* Casting binary data into C structs
* Pointer arithmetic
* Manual clean up
* Could use RAII in C++

---

# Error handling

* No exceptions
* Errors are handled with `Result` type
* `Result<T, E>` enum used for returning and propogating errors
  ```rust
  enum Result<T, E> {
       Ok(T),
       Err(E)
  }
  ```
* Match on `Result` to handle errors
  ```rust
  match File::create("example.txt") {
       Ok(_) => println!("Ok!"),
       Err(e) => println!("Err! {:?}", e),
  }
  ```

???

* T is the return type and E is the error type

---

# Error handling

* Use the `try!` macro to propogate the error
  ```rust
  fn create_file(filename: &str) -> io::Result<File> {
       let mut file = try!(File::create("example.txt"));
       file
  }
  ```
* Or just `unwrap` (`panic!` on error)
  ```rust
  let mut file = File::create("example.txt").unwrap();
  ```

???

* Can use try! instead of writing the same match statement everywhere

---

# Rust file loading

```rust
let mut file = try!(fs::File::open(&Path::new(filename)));

let mut bytes = Vec::new();
try!(file.read_to_end(&mut bytes));

let mut reader = BufferReader::new(bytes);
let header = try!(reader.pop_value::<MeshHeader>());

for _ in 0..header.num_chunks {
   let chunk_header = try!(reader.pop_value::<ChunkHeader>());
   match chunk_header.chunk_type { /* process chunk record */ }
}
```

???

* Will talk about the pop_value thing shortly

---

# Unsafe and casting

Wrote BufferReader to check bounds and handle ugly pointer arithmetic and casts.

```rust
pub struct BufferReader {
   buf: Vec<u8>,
   pos: usize
}
```

```rust
impl BufferReader {
   pub fn pop_value<'a, T>(&mut self) -> Result<&'a T, io::Error> {
      let pop_end = self.pos + mem::size_of::<T>();
      if pop_end > self.buf.len() {
         return Err(io::Error::new(
            io::ErrorKind::InvalidInput, "Buffer overrun"))
      }
      let ptr = unsafe {
         self.buf.as_ptr().offset(self.pos as isize) };
      self.pos = pop_end;
      Ok(unsafe { &*(ptr as *const T) })
   }
}
```

???

* You can see why I wrote a wrapper!
* Don't worry about error handing so much, looking at offset and casting for C people

---

# Unsafe and FFI

Foreign Function Interface for calling C functions.

```rust
struct Star {
  position: vmath::Vec3,
  color: vmath::Vec3
}
```

```rust
let mut stars = unsafe {
  slice::from_raw_parts_mut(
    gl::MapBufferRange(gl::ARRAY_BUFFER, 0,
       (NUM_STARS * mem::size_of::<Star>()) as GLsizeiptr,
        gl::MAP_WRITE_BIT | gl::MAP_INVALIDATE_BUFFER_BIT)
       as *mut Star, NUM_STARS)
};

for star in &mut stars[..] { /* update stars */ }
```

This is the ugliest example in my code, sorry!

???

* This is a particularly curly example
* Cast's a void pointer returned by MapBuffer back pointer to Star
* Can then create a Rust slice type from pointer and length
* Now have a safe array of stuff to iterate over

---

# Other uses for unsafe

* Low level algorithms and data structures
* Sometimes need mutable aliases
* Sometimes for performance

???

* E.g. double linked lists (just say no)
* Vec sort does insertion sort mem copy for performance

---

# Cargo

* Builds your code
* Downloads your dependencies
* Builds your dependencies (not just Rust)
* Runs tests and benchmarks
* Can build and execute Rust code as part of build
* Packages on https://crates.io/

???

* Being able to build and run arbitrary rust code makes this quite extensible

---

# Cargo

`Cargo.toml`

```ini
[package]
name = "sb6"
version = "0.0.1"
authors = ["Cameron Hart <cam@bitshifter.net.nz>"]
description = "OpenGL Super Bible 6 Application Framework"

[dependencies]
gl = "*"
log = "*"
num = "*"
rand = "*"

[dependencies.glfw]
git = "https://github.com/bitshifter/glfw-rs.git"
```

To build just run `cargo build`

???

* Stuff gets built to target/debug by default
* I still use Makefile for data

* After all of that, this is the result (one of them)
* SSAO = screen space ambient occlusion

# In conclusion

* I learned a lot about Rust
* No so much about OpenGL.red[*]
* Good background for future projects
* Code at https://github.com/bitshifter/sb6rust
* Rust is fun!
