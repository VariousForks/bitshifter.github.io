# C++ in games.red[*]

* Need Fine grained control over memory allocation, alignment
* Avoid deep object heirarchies
* Focus on data and data transformation
* Avoid runtime polymorphism
* No exceptions
* Increasingly parallel
* Immutability important
* Clear ownership and lifetime important

.footnote[.red[*] some are trends and some are personal preferences]

???

* No exceptions
  * compilers on some platforms didn't support them
  * lots of exception unsafe code
  * restricts optimisations
* Move semantics and unique_ptr with C++11 help with lifetime and ownership
* Const all of the things

---

# Rust ticks most boxes

* Clear ownership and lifetime of data is a language feature
* Move built-in to language
* No exceptions
* Compile time polymorphism
* Data (struct) separate from code (impl)
* Immutable by default
* Good safety guarantees for concurrency

On the down side
* Lacking fine grained control over allocation in std library

???

* Jealous about immubtable
* Security not a big issue for many games

---

# Developer tools

* No fancy IDE
* rust.vim
* println!
* log library
* rust-gdb
* apitrace for GL

template: inverse

# Demo time!

???

* Spinny cube
* SSAO?
